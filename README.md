## What is this?
In this repository is the code associated with the following paper: 

**Solek CM, Farooqi NAI, Brake N, Kesner P, Antel JP, Ruthazer ES. "Early inflammation dysregulates neuronal circuit formation in vivo via upregulation of IL-1Î²."**

There are four sections to this repository:
* **stimulus_presentation**. This contains the functions used to create the GUI for presenting visual stimuli.
* **data_analysis**. This contains the functions used to extract data from raw ThorLabs data files and analysis image and time series data.
* **misc_functions**. This contains miscellaneous functions.

I completed this work as an undergraduate research assistant in the [RuthazerLab](http://ruthazerlab.mcgill.ca/) in 2016-2017. A brief overview of the pipeline is presented in the document "Pipeline Overiew.docx".
